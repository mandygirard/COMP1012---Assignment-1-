                I am in my first year of Georgian College's Computer Programming and Analysis Course and am developing my skills in HTML, C#, Arduino, and Networking. 

            </p>
            <p>Previously to studying programming, I was employed by one of the worlds leading providers of ice-making products and services as part of the Graphic Production team. I played an essential role in printing, producing, and ensuring the quality of logos for corporations, including; The NHL, Hockey Canada, Curling Canada, and The International Olympic Committee. I pride myself on having excellent attention to detail, resulting in Non-Conformance Reports being down to less than 2% (from 5% the previous season).
            </p>
            <p>I have 5 years of Customer Service Experience resulting in exceptional communication, active listening, and problem-solving abilities. 
            </p>
            <p>I am always looking for opportunities to further my knowledge and develop new skills.
